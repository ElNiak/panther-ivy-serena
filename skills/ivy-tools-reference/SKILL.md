# Ivy Tools Reference -- Diagnostics MCP Server

## Role Division

The panther-ivy-plugin exposes **two** MCP servers with distinct responsibilities:

| Server | Role | Analogy |
|--------|------|---------|
| **ivy-tools** | Read-only diagnostics and analysis | Like pyright/eslint for Python/JS |
| **panther-serena** | Symbolic code manipulation and navigation | Like an IDE's refactoring engine |

**Use ivy-tools** for: verification, linting, coverage, traceability, dependency graphs.
**Use panther-serena** for: find/replace symbols, navigate code, edit files, create files.

See the `panther-serena-for-ivy` skill for panther-serena tool details.

## Tool Name Pattern

All ivy-tools MCP tools follow this prefix:

```
mcp__plugin_panther-ivy-plugin_ivy-tools__<tool_name>
```

## Tool Catalog

### Verification and Linting

#### ivy_verify

Run `ivy_check` on an Ivy file. Returns structured diagnostics.

```
Parameters:
  relative_path: str           # Path to .ivy file (relative to project root)
  isolate: str | None = None   # Optional isolate name

Returns: JSON {
  success: bool,
  diagnostics: [{file, line, severity, message}, ...],
  diagnostic_count: int,
  raw_output: str,
  duration_seconds: float
}
```

Timeout: 120 seconds. Checks isolate assumptions, invariants, and safety properties.

#### ivy_compile

Compile an Ivy file to a test executable using `ivyc`.

```
Parameters:
  relative_path: str           # Path to .ivy file
  target: str = "test"         # Compilation target
  isolate: str | None = None   # Optional isolate name

Returns: JSON {
  success: bool,
  output: str,
  duration_seconds: float
}
```

Timeout: 300 seconds. Produces a C++ test binary using Z3/SMT.

#### ivy_model_info

Display model structure using `ivy_show`.

```
Parameters:
  relative_path: str           # Path to .ivy file
  isolate: str | None = None   # Optional isolate name

Returns: JSON {
  success: bool,
  output: str,
  duration_seconds: float
}
```

Timeout: 30 seconds. Shows types, relations, actions, invariants, isolates.

#### ivy_lint

Fast structural lint (no subprocess, milliseconds).

```
Parameters:
  relative_path: str           # Path to .ivy file

Returns: JSON {
  file: str,
  diagnostics: [{line, severity, message, source}, ...],
  diagnostic_count: int,
  error_count: int,
  warning_count: int
}
```

Checks: missing `#lang` header, unmatched braces, unresolved includes. No external tools required.

### Dependency Analysis

#### ivy_include_graph

Return include dependency graph for Ivy files.

```
Parameters:
  relative_path: str | None = None  # Optional file to focus on

Returns (focused): JSON {
  file: str,
  includes: [{module, resolved_path}, ...],
  included_by: [str, ...],
  transitive_includes: [str, ...]
}

Returns (full project): JSON {
  files: {path: {includes: [str, ...]}},
  total_files: int
}
```

If a file is given, returns its direct includes, files that include it, and transitive closure. If omitted, returns the full project graph.

#### ivy_capabilities

Check which Ivy CLI tools are available on PATH.

```
Parameters: none

Returns: JSON {
  ivy_check: bool,
  ivyc: bool,
  ivy_show: bool
}
```

Use this first to determine which verification tools are available before calling `ivy_verify`, `ivy_compile`, or `ivy_model_info`.

### Traceability and Semantic Analysis

These tools build a semantic model from RFC requirement manifests and bracket-tag annotations in `.ivy` files. The model is built lazily on first use and cached.

#### ivy_traceability_matrix

RFC requirement-to-annotation mapping.

```
Parameters:
  relative_path: str | None = None  # Optional file to scope to

Returns: JSON {
  total_requirements: int,
  covered: int,
  uncovered: int,
  matrix: [{id, rfc, section, level, text, covered, assertions}, ...]
}
```

Shows which RFC requirements have corresponding bracket-tag annotations in the codebase.

#### ivy_requirement_coverage

Coverage statistics by MUST/SHOULD/MAY level and layer.

```
Parameters:
  relative_path: str | None = None  # Optional file to scope to

Returns: JSON {
  total: int,
  covered: int,
  uncovered: int,
  coverage_percent: float,
  by_level: {MUST: {total, covered}, SHOULD: {...}, MAY: {...}},
  by_layer: {layer_name: {total, covered}, ...}
}
```

#### ivy_impact_analysis

Incoming and outgoing edges for a symbol in the semantic model.

```
Parameters:
  symbol_name: str             # Symbol name or qualified name

Returns: JSON {
  symbol: str,
  found: bool,
  qualified_name: str,
  kind: str,
  file: str,
  line: int,
  incoming_edges: [{type, source}, ...],
  outgoing_edges: [{type, target}, ...],
  total_references: int
}
```

#### ivy_extract_requirements

Parse RFC text for normative statements (MUST/SHOULD/MAY).

```
Parameters:
  rfc_text: str                # Raw RFC text to parse

Returns: JSON {
  requirements: [{text, level, offset}, ...],
  total: int,
  by_level: {MUST: int, SHOULD: int, MAY: int, ...}
}
```

Normalizes RFC 2119 keywords: SHALL -> MUST, REQUIRED -> MUST, RECOMMENDED -> SHOULD, OPTIONAL -> MAY.

#### ivy_cross_references

Query cross-reference graph neighborhood of a node.

```
Parameters:
  node_id: str                 # Node ID (e.g., "test.ivy:5:send")

Returns: JSON {
  node_id: str,
  found: bool,
  node_type: str,
  incoming: [{type, source}, ...],
  outgoing: [{type, target}, ...]
}
```

#### ivy_query_symbol

Rich semantic info about a symbol: type, references, requirements.

```
Parameters:
  symbol_name: str             # Symbol name or qualified name

Returns: JSON {
  symbol: str,
  found: bool,
  symbol_info: {qualified_name, kind, file, line, params, return_sort, sort_name},
  type_info: {qualified_name, file, line, sort_name, is_enum, variants},
  references: {incoming: int, outgoing: int}
}
```

Returns symbol details if it exists as a SymbolNode, type details if it exists as a TypeNode, or both.

## Recommended Workflows

### Quick Health Check

```
1. ivy_capabilities           # Are tools available?
2. ivy_lint(file)             # Fast structural check (ms)
3. ivy_verify(file)           # Full formal verification (seconds)
```

### Coverage Audit

```
1. ivy_requirement_coverage() # Overall stats
2. ivy_traceability_matrix()  # Detailed per-requirement view
3. ivy_include_graph(file)    # Understand dependency structure
```

### Impact Assessment Before Editing

```
1. ivy_query_symbol(name)     # Understand the symbol
2. ivy_impact_analysis(name)  # What depends on it?
3. ivy_cross_references(id)   # Full neighborhood
4. ivy_verify(file)           # After editing, re-verify
```
